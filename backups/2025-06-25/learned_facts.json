  "what is the solar system?": "The solar system is a gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, including eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. The Sun contains the majority of the system's mass, and its gravitational pull keeps the planets and other objects in orbit around it.",
  "what is the milky way galaxy?": "The Milky Way galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy that contains our solar system and billions of other stars, planets, and celestial objects. It is estimated to be about 100,000 light-years in diameter and contains hundreds of billions of stars. The Milky Way has a central bulge surrounded by a flat disk with spiral arms, where most of the galaxy's stars are located. The galaxy also has a halo of hot gas and dark matter surrounding it. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, a collection of galaxies that includes the Andromeda Galaxy and several smaller galaxies.",
  "what is the universe?": "The universe is the vast, all-encompassing space that contains all matter, energy, planets, stars, galaxies, and the fundamental forces of nature. It is everything that exists, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxy clusters. The universe is estimated to be about 13.8 billion years old and has been expanding since the Big Bang, the event that marked the beginning of space and time as we know it.",
  "what is the big bang theory?": "The Big Bang theory is the leading scientific explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense point approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. As the universe expanded, it cooled, allowing matter to form and eventually leading to the creation of galaxies, stars, and planets. The theory is supported by various lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the observed redshift of distant galaxies.",
  "what is the theory of relativity?": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, consists of two interrelated theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, published in 1905, revolutionized the understanding of space and time, introducing the concept that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. It also established the famous equation E=mc², which describes the equivalence of mass and energy. General relativity, published in 1915, expanded on this by describing gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. This theory has been confirmed through various experiments and observations, including the bending of light around massive objects and the detection of gravitational waves.",
  "what is quantum mechanics?": "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It introduces concepts that differ significantly from classical physics, including wave-particle duality, uncertainty principles, and superposition. Quantum mechanics explains phenomena such as the quantization of energy levels in atoms, the behavior of electrons in orbitals, and the principles underlying technologies like semiconductors and lasers. It has been confirmed through numerous experiments and is a cornerstone of modern physics.",
  "what is the theory of evolution?": "The theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, explains how species change over time through the process of natural selection. It posits that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to future generations. Over long periods, this leads to the gradual evolution of species. The theory is supported by extensive evidence from various fields, including paleontology, genetics, and comparative anatomy. It provides a scientific framework for understanding the diversity of life on Earth and how organisms adapt to their environments.",
  "what is the difference between science and pseudoscience?": "Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. It relies on empirical evidence, experimentation, and peer review. Pseudoscience, on the other hand, refers to beliefs or practices that claim to be scientific but lack supporting evidence and cannot be tested or falsified. Pseudoscience often relies on anecdotal evidence, appeals to authority, and confirmation bias.",
  "what is 2 + 2?": "2 + 2 equals 4.",
  "what is 3 * 3?": "3 * 3 equals 9.",
  "what is 10 / 2?": "10 / 2 equals 5.",
  "what is 5 - 3?": "5 - 3 equals 2.",
  "what is the square root of 16?": "The square root of 16 is 4.",
  "what is the area of a circle with a radius of 3?": "The area of a circle with a radius of 3 is 28.27 square units.",
  "what is the circumference of a circle with a radius of 3?": "The circumference of a circle with a radius of 3 is 18.85 units.",
  "what is the volume of a sphere with a radius of 3?": "The volume of a sphere with a radius of 3 is approximately 113.1 cubic units.",
  "what is 1 + 1?": "1 + 1 equals 2.",
  "what is 2 * 2?": "2 * 2 equals 4.",
  "what is 4 / 2?": "4 / 2 equals 2.",
  "what is 5 - 2?": "5 - 2 equals 3.",
  "what is the square root of 25?": "The square root of 25 is 5."
