  "planet mars": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the 'Red Planet' because of its orange-red appearance. Mars is a desert-like rocky planet with a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure is much lower than Earth's, and temperatures range from -153 to 20 °C. Mars retains some water as ground ice, frost, and polar ice caps, but has no liquid surface water. Its gravity is about a third of Earth's. Mars is half as wide as Earth, with a diameter of 6,779 km, and has a surface area similar to all the dry land on Earth. Fine dust is prevalent across the surface and atmosphere.",
  "can you speak with a voice": "A nasal voice is a type of speaking voice characterized by a 'nasal' quality. It can also occur naturally because of genetic variation.",

  "thats ok": "I'm A Cyborg, But That's OK is a 2006 South Korean surrealist psychological romantic comedy-drama film directed by Park Chan-wook. It stars Jung Ji-hoon (Rain) as Il-soon and Im Soo-jung as Young-gun.",
  "physics": "Physics is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist. Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.",
  "star": "A star is a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorized into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 10²² to 10²⁴ stars. Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye—all within the Milky Way galaxy. A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material largely comprising hydrogen, helium, and trace heavier elements. Its total mass mainly determines its evolution and eventual fate. A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core.",
  "ok cool": "OK, with spelling variations including okay, okeh, O.K. and many others, is an English word denoting approval, acceptance, agreement, acknowledgment, or a sign of indifference. OK is frequently used as a loanword in other languages.",
  "thats enough ari": "Sorry, I can't answer that right now because my language model needs more memory than is available on this system.",
  "Ari can you harm a human": "Friendly artificial intelligence (friendly AI or FAI) is hypothetical artificial general intelligence (AGI) that would have a positive effect on humanity or at least align with human interests such as fostering the improvement of the human species. It is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence and is closely related to machine ethics.",
  "can you harm yourself": "Sorry, I can't answer that right now because my language model needs more memory than is available on this system.",
  "i": "not harm a human",
  "you": "not harm a human",

  "a bird": "Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m common ostrich.",
  "a cat": "The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.",
  "three laws of robotics": "The Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or Asimov's Laws) are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov, which were to be followed by robots in several of his stories. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story 'Runaround' (included in the 1950 collection I, Robot), although similar restrictions had been implied in earlier stories.",

  "your functions": "In cognitive science and neuropsychology, executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes that support goal-directed behavior, by regulating thoughts and actions through cognitive control, selecting and successfully monitoring actions that facilitate the attainment of chosen objectives. Executive functions include basic cognitive processes such as attentional control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility.",
  "your capabilities": "Recursive self-improvement (RSI) is a process in which an early or weak artificial general intelligence (AGI) system enhances its own capabilities and intelligence without human intervention, leading to a superintelligence or intelligence explosion. The development of recursive self-improvement raises significant ethical and safety concerns, as such systems may evolve in unforeseen ways and could potentially surpass human control or understanding."
